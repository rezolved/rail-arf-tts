# Task Objective

Fix the clipping heuristic that over-flags peak-normalized clips, LUFS-normalize the full v5 corpus
to -14 LUFS, and produce a near-full-corpus clean train manifest.

* * *

## Step History

### Step 1 — create-branch

Branch `task/t0012_v5_corpus_normalize_and_reaudit` created. Initial folder structure initialized in
`tasks/t0012_v5_corpus_normalize_and_reaudit/`. Step 1 is a mechanical setup step with no research
output.

### Step 2 — check-deps

Verified dependency `t0011_v5_data_quality_audit` has `status: completed` in its `task.json`, so the
dependency check passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings. Result recorded in
`logs/steps/002_check-deps/deps_report.json`. No caveats for downstream steps.

### Step 4 — research-papers

Skipped: LUFS normalization (EBU R128) is a standard, well-documented technique; no literature
validation is needed beyond t0011's prior research and its own creative-thinking findings.

### Step 5 — research-internet

Skipped: not in data-analysis `optional_steps`; task operates entirely on local audio data and prior
task code, no new external information needed.

### Step 8 — setup-machines

Skipped: task is CPU-only (pyloudnorm + soundfile on 1557 clips), no remote compute needed.

### Step 10 — teardown

Skipped: `setup-machines` was skipped, so there are no remote machines to tear down.

### Step 13 — compare-literature

Skipped: not in data-analysis `optional_steps`; this task's outputs (clean-manifest size, flag
counts) are not comparable to published baselines.

## Next Step Notes

Step 2 completed successfully; the only declared dependency (`t0011_v5_data_quality_audit`) is
satisfied. Proceed to step 3 (`init-folders`) per `step_tracker.json`: create the mandatory task
folder structure via `init_task_folders` and populate the aggregator cache under `ctx/`.
